In this line of research, we investigate decision-making processes in competitive sports through an integrated approach that combines data collection, statistical analysis, and computational modeling. By collaborating with clubs and technology companies, we study how athletes and teams make strategic choices under conditions of uncertainty, time pressure, and interaction with opponents. Our methodology draws on network science to characterize passing structures and spatial organization in football, statistical and cognitive models to analyze decision patterns in chess, and stochastic process frameworks to examine the dynamics of rallies and point-to-point actions in sports such as volleyball and padel. Through these tools, we aim to identify the principles that govern individual and collective decision-making, and to understand how they influence performance and competitive outcomes.
